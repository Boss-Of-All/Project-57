	Hi,I am 11 years old.I am in 6th standard. My hobby is a sport called Cricket.Whenever play I have to look at the ball properly and play it. It is very fun.I love Cricket.It is my dream to be a cricketer.Cricket helps in concentration and physical body balance.It also helps in fitness.It somehow makes me a partriot for playing for India if I do.It is a good source of discipline,concenteration,inspiration,physical body balance.It makes me a succesful person.
